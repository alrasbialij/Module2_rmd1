## R Markdown
### This is a level 3 Header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
Here is a link to [Google](http://google.com)
Here is a word in **bold** an another word in __bold__.
Here is a word in *italic* an another word in _italic_.

When we compile our document, we are using `Rmarkdown`package.

Here are some example R commands:
```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9))

```
Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - Food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - Drink
        + apple juce
* Lunch
    - Taco
* Dinner
    - Baked chicken
    - Broccoli
    - Rice
1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i eggs
        ii toast
        iii bacon
    b. drink
        i apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice









When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
